# Building Micro Frontends with React, Vue, and Single-spa
This repo is an example of micro-frontends, as described here: https://micro-frontends.org/.    
It is an extension of this project: https://github.com/dabit3/micro-frontend-example, which uses https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa.  
I followed this tutorial: https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-to-do-app-with-vue-js-2#toc-prerequisites to quickly build a Vue microfrontend, then built a React microfrontend to demonstrate how to communicate between the two using Custom Javascript Events.  
## To run
```
npm install
npm start
```
